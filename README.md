# This is my dotfiles, there are many like them, but this is mine

My dotfiles are using [darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to setup my MacOS.

*How to:*

* run the `bootstrap.sh` script to install the nessacary tools.
* Install programs + dotfiles using `darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/Projects/dotfiles#MacBook-Pro`
* Manually import the raycast config
* Manually set the norly Warp theme

*A huge thanks to:*
